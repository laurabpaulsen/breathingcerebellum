## To-do
- [X] Determine ISI for block A and B based on the respiratory rate in block with same ISI as in block B
- [X] Implement QUEST correctly (currently just adjusting according to the proportion of correct responses)
- [x] Reset QUEST at certain points
- [ ] Define some minimum or maximum values of ISI's?
- [X] Timing of experiment
- [ ] Handle the case were more than 7 stepping stones are needed to adjust from current to target intensity
    - Not a problem if the intensity of the salient stimuli is below 8
