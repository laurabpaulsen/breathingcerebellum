## To-do
- [ ] Communication with stimulus current generator 
    - Adjusting intensity 
    - OBS limits on how the intensity can be adjusted -> might need one for salient and one for weak but connected to the same ring electrodes?
- [X] Determine ISI for block A and B based on the respiratory rate in block with same ISI as in block B
- [X] First block to determine respiration rate + take input from user with the rate
- [ ] Implement QUEST correctly (currently just adjusting according to the proportion of correct responses)
- [x] Reset QUEST at certain points
- [ ] Define some minimum or maximum values of ISI's
- [ ] Timing of experiment
